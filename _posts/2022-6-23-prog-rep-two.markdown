<p>In this week of working on the “Visualizing Caribbean Literature” group project I continued my work on editing the Author Country column in the shared spreadsheet to reflect the author’s country of birth, or to show their relation to the Caribbean. <br> When working on the Author Country column there were two other columns, the Author column and Wikipedia URL column, that I used. I first went to the Wikipedia URL column. This column could either be the wikipedia link to the book or the author. In most cases the link was for the author, so after going there I would cross check its correctness with the author in the Author column. This made it a lot quicker for me to search through the authors rather than typing in their names constantly. <br>

There were some instances when I found information that was incorrect or in the wrong column. In the instance of wrong information it is where I believed the author was not Caribbean and therefore should not be in the spreadsheet, in this case I left a comment for Kyra who was working on the author column and highlighted the row. The second instance is where an illustrator ws in the Author column, in this case I was able to simply move the illustrator's name to the illustrator column.<br>

This week I made a mistake where I placed the author's country in the OCLC column. I realized at the end of working on the column for the day. I asked if anyone was working on that column and luckily no one was plus the information could be traced back through the Zotero. The next day I put the information into the correct column and continued to work.

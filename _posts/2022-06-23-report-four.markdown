<p>In this week of working on the “Visualizing Caribbean Literature” group project I worked on three tasks in the shared spreadsheet.<br>

I continued to work on the Author Country 2 column which was for persons who were born somewhere outside the Caribbean, but were raised in the Caribbean. This work did not take much of my time as I had done most of it in the prior week.<br>

The second task I took on was one relating to my individual project. My individual project is related to translations of Caribbean authors' books. After a talk with Dr. Esprit, I began my work on the project by focusing on an author first. So for my second task I added translations of books by Edwidge Danticat into the group spreadsheet. I also added missing information I found on translations of Edwidge Danticat.

<p>In this week of working on the “Visualizing Caribbean Literature” group project I was assigned to do some edits on two columns I had worked on. First, the Language column I had done in the first semester, and second the Author Country column.<br>

The Language column was to reflect the language or languages that a book was written in. However, a change was made so that if there was a second language it would be placed in a new Language 2 column. In the case of a book having more than two languages listed, I asked and was told to add these other languages in a comment. So I did so in the Language 2 column.<br>

The second task I had for that week dealt with a new Author Country 2 column. At first I misinterpreted the task as the authors of the book having separate columns for their country of birth. I later got clarification that the Author Country 2 column was for persons who were born somewhere outside the Caribbean, but were raised in the Caribbean.

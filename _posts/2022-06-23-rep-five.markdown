<p>This week I continued work on my individual project about the translations of Caribbean authors. I focused on two main tasks this week, making my spreadsheets and researching.<br>

The spreadsheet I began to make this week was on the author Edwidge Danticat that I am focusing on. This author will not be the only author I look at for my individual project, but I decided to start with her books first. The first thing I did was copy her information from the “Visualizing Caribbean Literature” group project. I transferred this information to what would be my first sheet on Danticat. I deleted the columns that I would not need and arranged them to my liking.
